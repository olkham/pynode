UI/UX
- ✓ make the error/debug messages clickable to take you to the node throwing them (already implemented)

NODES
- use FrameSource for general image capture (reuse from inference_node)
- use inference engine (reuse from inference_node)
- add multiple destinations (reuse from inference_node)

GENERAL
- workflow wide services like mqtt so we can reuse the same mqtt client for pub node and sub node

MESSAGES
- check the inputs / outputs / arrays etc. are a standard form so node can be easily connected with little to no config
- allow variables to be set at msg level that can be used for the values in a node i.e.
    - msg.label = 'person' will use the label in the filter node
    - likewise the output message from nodes will contain the properties
    - msg.payload will contain the actual data
