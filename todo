UI/UX
- hide/close properties panel
- unity like debug filter
    - colapse similar errors (put a counter for the number of occurances)
    - show/hide info messages
    - show/hide error messages
- make the error/debug messages clickable to take you to the node throwing them

NODES
- use FrameSource for general image capture (reuse from inference_node)
- use inference engine (reuse from inference_node)
- add multiple destinations (reuse from inference_node)

GENERAL
- workflow wide services like mqtt so we can reuse the same mqtt client for pub node and sub node
